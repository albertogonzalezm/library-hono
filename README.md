### Create an API for a library management system. This API will have the following characteristics:

***Book Management:*** Users could add, update, delete and search books in the database. Each book would have attributes such as title, author, genre, year of publication, etc.

***User Management:*** Users could register, log in and log out. You could also update your profile information.

***Book lending:*** Users could borrow books from the library. The API would keep track of which books are checked out and who has them.

***Reservations:*** If a book is checked out, users could reserve it so that they are notified when the book is available again.

***Borrowing History:*** Users could view their borrowing history, including which books they have borrowed and when.

***Comments and Ratings:*** Users could leave comments and ratings on books they have read.
